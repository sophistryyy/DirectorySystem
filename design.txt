
Making a File System

PART 1:
    read file system super block and use the info to read the FAT

    ./diskinfo test.img

    Sample Output:

    Super block information:
    Block size: 512
    Block count: 5120
    FAT starts: 1
    FAT blocks: 40
    Root directory start: 41
    Root directory block: 8

    FAT information:
    Free Blocks: 5071
    Reserved Blocks: 41
    Allocated Blocks: 8

Part 2:
    displays contents of root directory or any sub-directory in file system 

    ./disklist test.img /sub_dir

    First column:
        F for regular files, D for directories, then a single space
    Second column:
        10 characters for file size followed by single space
    Third column:
        30 chars for file name followed by single space
    Fourth column:
        file creation date (not modification date)

    Sample Output:
    F      2560      foo.txt  2005/11/15 12:00:00
    F      5120      foo2.txt 2005/11/15 12:00:00

Part 3:
    copies file from file system to current directory in linux
    if file not found in root or given sub-directory output "File not found" and exit

    ./diskget test.img /sub_dir/foo2.txt foo.txt

Part 4:
    copies file from current linux directory into file system at root or given sub-directory
    If file not found, output "File not found" and exit

    ./diskput test.img foo.txt /sub_dir/foo3.txt

Part 5: 
    go through disk image (including super block, FAT, FDT and data blocks)
    find inconsistent info and fix issues when possible
    *specifications in assignment pdf*

    output problems that were identified and fixed

    ./diskfix test.img

Specifications:
    FAT has three components:
        super block
        directory structure
        File Allocation Table, FAT
